What defines a line? Basically, it is a string with a newline at the end;

linux commands
od -x main.cpp
this reads the file in bytes

strings are related to pullingin groups of bytes

byte = 8 bits
ie. 2a2f = 16 bits

look up ASCII chart on duckduck // the od command on line 4 will display the hexidecimal code.
big ndn vs little ndn... the way the bytes are read. 

Endianness / or 'Endian byte order' - related to Assembly languages etc.

In hexidecimal, 0xa... 0x is the prefix, a is the value

in linux, ctrl D is end of file, and ctrl Z in windows.

vim
jobs
